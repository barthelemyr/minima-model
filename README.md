# MINIMA — Minimal Innovation Model for Public Administrations

MINIMA is a pragmatic innovation model designed for public administrations.
It provides a structured and iterative framework to **build innovation capacity by consolidating existing practices before introducing change**.

Innovation in MINIMA is not about disruption for its own sake.
It is about stabilising what exists in order to create space, capacity and legitimacy for innovation.

## Purpose of the model

MINIMA is designed to:

- start small and concrete,
- reduce complexity,
- progressively increase organisational maturity,
- and create sustainable capacity for innovation.

The model can be used in two complementary ways:

- as a **framework to establish innovation governance**, at local or organisation-wide level,
- as a **practical structure for innovation-related projects**, initiatives or experiments.

The same model applies in both contexts. 
The difference lies in scope and responsibility, not in the logic of the model.

## Structure of the model

MINIMA is built around:

- **Six iterative steps**: Methods, Integrate, Navigate, Iterate, Measure, Adapt,
- **Three concentric circles**, representing different types of innovation: incremental, adaptive and transformative.

The model is iterative by design.
Each cycle consolidates practices, strengthens organisational capabilities and progressively enables more ambitious forms of innovation.
