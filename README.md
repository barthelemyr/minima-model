# MINIMA — Minimal Innovation Model for Public Administrations

MINIMA is a pragmatic innovation model designed for public administrations. It provides structured and iterative framework to **build innovation capacity by consolidating existing practices before introducing change**.

The model is designed to:
- start small and concrete,
- reduce complexity,
- increase organisational maturity over time,
- and create sustainable capacity for innovation.

## Structure of the model

MINIMA is built around:
- **Six iterative steps**: Methods, Integrate, Navigate, Iterate, Measure, Adapt.
- **Three concentric circles**, representing increasing levels of scope and maturity,

The model is iterative by design. 
Each cycle strengthens organisational capabilities and prepares the ground for the next level of innovation.
