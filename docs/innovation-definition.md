# Innovation in Public Administrations

In the context of public administrations, innovation is:

> The intentional improvement of public value creation through new or improved services, processes, organisational practices or policies, within existing legal, financial and institutional constraints.

Innovation in public administrations:
- is not limited to technology,
- must respect legal and democratic principles,
- aims at improving public value, not competitive advantage.

Innovation can be:
- incremental (improving what exists),
- adaptive (responding to change),
- transformative (changing structures or models).

MINIMA focuses on **creating the conditions for innovation**:
by consolidating, simplifying and stabilising existing systems and practices before introducing change.
