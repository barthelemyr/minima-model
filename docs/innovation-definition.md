# Innovation in Public Administrations

In the context of public administrations, innovation is:

> The intentional effort to enhance public value creation by implementing and learning from new or improved services, processes, organisational practices, policies or technologies, within existing legal, financial, institutional and ethical constraints.

Innovation in public administrations:
- is not limited to technology,
- must respect legal and democratic principles,
- aims at improving public value, not competitive advantage.

Innovation can be:
- incremental (improving what exists),
- adaptive (responding to change),
- transformative (changing structures or models).

MINIMA focuses on **creating the conditions for innovation**:
by consolidating, simplifying and stabilising existing systems and practices before introducing change.
