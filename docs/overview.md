# MINIMA – Model Overview

MINIMA (Minimal Innovation Model for Public Administrations) provides a simple, pragmatic and structured approach to initiate and steer innovation in the public sector.

It is designed to support public administrations in introducing innovation in a controlled, realistic and sustainable way, taking into account organisational maturity, strategic objectives and the specific constraints of the public sector.

## Core principle

**Consolidate to innovate.**

Innovation is a progressive process.
Before introducing change, existing practices, processes and structures must be stabilised and clarified in order to create room, capacity and legitimacy for innovation.

MINIMA acknowledges the specific constraints of public administrations, particularly in terms of:
- resources (time, budget, skills),
- governance and accountability,
- responsibility towards citizens and public value.

## Scope of application

MINIMA can be applied at different levels of an administration:

### Innovation governance
MINIMA can be used as a framework to:
- establish or structure innovation governance,
- define shared principles and practices,
- align innovation efforts with strategic priorities,
- and progressively build organisational innovation capacity.

This applies both at:
- local level (unit, department),
- and organisation-wide level.

### Innovation projects
MINIMA can also be applied to:
- specific innovation projects,
- pilot initiatives,
- experimental services, processes or policies.

In this context, MINIMA provides a clear structure to frame decisions, manage uncertainty and ensure learning.

The same model applies in both cases.
The difference lies in scope and responsibility, not in the logic of the model.

## The three innovation circles

MINIMA distinguishes three types of innovation, represented as concentric circles:

- **Incremental innovation**: improving and consolidating existing services, processes or practices.
- **Transformative innovation**: rethinking processes, organisational arrangements or modes of operation.
- **Disruptive innovation**: exploring new models, roles or approaches.

These circles help public administrations innovate at the right level, with governance, resources and indicators adapted to each type of innovation.
Not all initiatives aim at the outer circles.
Progression depends on context, capacity and strategic intent.

## The MINIMA steps

MINIMA structures innovation activities through six iterative steps:

### Methods
Select a simple and shared methodological basis, adapted to the targeted type of innovation, and integrate user experience considerations from the outset.

### Integrate
Anchor innovation within existing governance structures and create concrete feasibility conditions, particularly in terms of time and budget.

### Navigate
Define a clear direction, prioritise focus areas and reduce silos, in line with user needs and internal capacities.

### Iterate
Test with real users, adjust based on concrete feedback, and decide on controlled deployment.

### Measure
Measure impact and learning to support decision-making, make results visible and capitalise on experience.

### Adapt
Sustain what works by anchoring it in the organisation, or explicitly stop what does not create value.

## An iterative model

MINIMA is iterative by design.
Each cycle consolidates practices, strengthens organisational capabilities and prepares the ground for more ambitious forms of innovation when appropriate.
