# MINIMA – Model Overview

MINIMA is designed as a **capacity-building model**.

The objective is not to produce isolated innovations,
but to progressively increase an organisation’s ability to innovate in a sustainable way.

The model combines:
- using existing structures,
- iteration without chaos,
- consolidation as a prerequisite for innovation.

MINIMA is composed of:
- three concentric circles (scope and maturity),
- six iterative steps (Methods, Integrate, Navigate, Iterate, Measure, Adapt).

Each iteration strengthens:
- organisational clarity,
- process stability,
- and decision-making capacity.
