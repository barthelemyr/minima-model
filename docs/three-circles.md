# The Three Innovation Circles

MINIMA distinguishes three types of innovation, represented as concentric circles.
They do not form a hierarchy of value, nor an obligation to progress from one to another.

The purpose of the circles is to help public administrations innovate at the **right level**, with governance, resources, methods and indicators adapted to each type of innovation and to the intended creation of public value.

Each circle requires different approaches, but all contribute equally to serving citizens and improving public service quality.

## Incremental innovation — Consolidating what exists

Incremental innovation focuses on improving and stabilising existing services, processes and practices.

It is the most common and most accessible form of innovation in public administrations.
Its primary objective is to consolidate the existing system in order to improve service quality, efficiency and user experience, and to strengthen value to citizens.

### Typical characteristics
- Continuous improvement
- Low risk
- Strong connection to operational reality
- Short feedback loops
- **Visible and measurable results**

### Governance and resources
- Based on existing governance structures
- Limited and clearly identified time allocation
- No dedicated budget or very limited targeted funding

### Practical examples
- Simplifying a form based on user complaints
- Reducing waiting time through better scheduling
- Standardising communication templates across offices

### When to use
- To improve service quality and reliability
- To reduce friction and inefficiencies
- To respond to concrete user feedback
- **To stabilise operations before pursuing more complex innovation**

## Transformative innovation — Reconfiguring ways of working

Transformative innovation aims to rethink processes, organisational arrangements and modes of operation.

It goes beyond the improvement of individual elements and addresses systemic issues across services, units or value chains, with the objective of significantly increasing public value.

### Typical characteristics
- Medium to high organisational impact
- Cross-functional scope
- **Managed uncertainty with clear scope**
- Requires coordination and change management

### Governance and resources
- Reinforced or cross-functional governance
- Clear prioritisation at management level
- Dedicated time and coordination resources
- Targeted budget where necessary

### Practical examples
- Redesigning a complete permit process from application to delivery
- Creating a one-stop shop combining services from multiple departments
- Implementing cross-agency collaboration for complex user needs

### When to use
- To address structural inefficiencies
- To improve end-to-end user journeys
- To break organisational silos
- To align operations with strategic and policy objectives
- **To scale proven incremental improvements into systemic change**

## Disruptive innovation — Exploring new possibilities

Disruptive innovation explores new models, roles or approaches for public administrations.

It challenges existing assumptions and focuses on future uses, emerging needs or alternative ways of creating public value, without presuming immediate deployment.

### Typical characteristics
- High uncertainty
- Exploratory and learning-oriented
- **Acceptable failure as learning**
- **Deliberately limited scope**
- Time-bound experimentation

### Governance and resources
- Dedicated and protected governance
- Explicit experimentation budget
- Clear framing and exit criteria
- **Explicit decision points for continuation or termination**

### Practical examples
- Testing AI-powered citizen services with uncertain outcomes
- Piloting participatory budgeting with new governance models
- Exploring blockchain for public registries
- Experimenting with new modes of policy co-creation

### When to use
- To explore long-term societal or technological challenges
- To test new roles or mandates for public administrations
- To anticipate change and inform strategic decisions
- To create learning rather than immediate operational impact

## Common misconceptions

**“We should aim for disruptive innovation”**  
→ Most public value is created through incremental and transformative innovation. Disruptive innovation is appropriate only for specific strategic questions.

**“Incremental innovation is not real innovation”**  
→ Continuous improvement is essential and creates significant value to citizens. It also builds the capacity needed for more ambitious innovation.

**“We must progress through all circles”**  
→ The circles are not stages. Choose the right level based on the challenge, not on ambition.

**“Different circles need different teams”**  
→ The same teams can work across circles, adapting their methods, governance and tools to the challenge.

## Using the circles in MINIMA

### The circles are not a ladder
Public administrations do not need to “reach” disruptive innovation to be successful.  
**Most public value is created through incremental and transformative innovation.**

### Multiple circles can coexist
Administrations can simultaneously:
- consolidate core services (incremental),
- redesign major user journeys (transformative),
- explore future possibilities (disruptive).

The key is to match the right approach to the right challenge.

### MINIMA principles for working with the circles
- **Innovate where it is most relevant**, not where it is most fashionable
- **Match ambition with capacity**, ensuring initiatives are credible and sustainable
- **Consolidate before exploring**, creating room and legitimacy for ambitious innovation
- **Learn and strengthen capacity** with each cycle, enabling more ambitious work when appropriate

Each circle contributes to public value. The goal is strategic alignment, not progression through circles.

## How the circles relate to the MINIMA steps

All six MINIMA steps (Methods, Integrate, Navigate, Iterate, Measure, Adapt) apply to each circle, but with **different intensity, tools and governance**.

For example:
- **Methods** for incremental innovation use simple tools; for disruptive innovation, exploratory frameworks
- **Integrate** for incremental innovation relies on existing governance; for disruptive innovation, it creates dedicated structures
- **Measure** for incremental innovation focuses on efficiency and service quality; for disruptive innovation, on learning and insight

(See the detailed step pages for more information.)
