# Measure — Measuring to decide and create public value

## Expected outcome
Measure the impact of initiatives to support decision-making, demonstrate public value and capitalise on learning.

## Key actors
Analytical and communicative employees.

Depending on the context, this may include:
- performance managers,
- data analysts,
- communication specialists.

## Tools (non-exhaustive)
Measurement relies on **indicators and evaluation instruments**.

Typical tools include:
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Public value assessment frameworks
- User satisfaction and experience surveys
- Process and efficiency metrics
- Learning and hypothesis validation indicators

Indicators should remain limited, relevant and decision-oriented.

## Key actions

### Incremental innovation
- Efficiency indicators (e.g. processing time, error rate)
- User satisfaction indicators (e.g. NPS, complaint reduction)

### Transformative innovation
- Indicators related to process performance
- Collaboration quality
- User experience improvement

### Disruptive innovation
- Learning indicators
- Potential impact and future public value indicators

Measurement should always inform a decision: continue, adapt, scale or stop.

## Common challenges / Watch out for
- Measuring too much or too late
- Indicators disconnected from decisions
- Focusing only on efficiency and neglecting public value

## Practical example
Processing time and user satisfaction are measured to decide whether a redesigned service should be scaled.

## Next step
Based on measured impact and learning, the next step is to **adapt, institutionalise or stop initiatives**.
