# Integrate — Governing innovation

## Expected outcome
Identify key internal and external stakeholders, integrate innovation into existing governance, and create concrete feasibility conditions, particularly in terms of time and budget.

This step ensures that innovation efforts are credible, supported and aligned with public responsibilities.

## Key actors
Organisational leaders, financial managers, HR managers and operational managers.

Depending on the context, this may also include:
- innovation coordinators or programme managers,
- external partners (other administrations, academia, private sector, civil society).

## Tools (non-exhaustive)
Integration relies on **governance and resource instruments**, not on creativity tools.

Typical tools include:
- Governance charters or mandates
- Steering committees or cross-functional coordination bodies
- Innovation portfolios or initiative registers
- Explicit time allocation mechanisms
- Dedicated or earmarked experimentation budgets

These tools should remain lightweight and proportionate to organisational capacity.

## Key actions

### Incremental innovation
**Governance**
- Rely on existing governance structures
- Clarify decision-making responsibilities

**Resources**
- Free up limited time for continuous improvement
- Integrate innovation into daily activities without creating overload

### Transformative innovation
**Governance**
- Strengthen cross-functional governance
- Clarify trade-offs between operational priorities and innovation initiatives

**Resources**
- Allocate dedicated time and coordination capacity
- Provide targeted budget where necessary

### Disruptive innovation
**Governance**
- Establish dedicated governance structures
- Define clear mandates and decision rules

**Resources**
- Define an explicit experimentation budget
- Protect exploration time, distinct from operational obligations

In all cases, MINIMA promotes explicit and transparent resource management as a prerequisite for credible and sustainable innovation.

## Common challenges / Watch out for
- Implicit expectations without allocated resources
- Innovation treated as “extra work”
- Unclear decision authority

## Practical example
Management formalises a small innovation budget and allocates protected time for selected teams, enabling initiatives to progress without operational overload.

## Next step
Once innovation is integrated into governance and resourced appropriately, the next step is to **navigate and prioritise where to focus efforts**.
