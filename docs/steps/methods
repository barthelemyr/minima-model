# Methods — Building a solid foundation

## Expected outcome
Establish a clear and shared methodological foundation, adapted to the targeted type of innovation, allowing the consolidation of existing practices while integrating user experience (citizens, businesses and partners) from the very first steps.

By clarifying methods early, administrations create the conditions for generating public value in a structured and credible way.

## Key actors
Employees at all hierarchical levels who initiate or support innovation initiatives.

Depending on the organisational context, this may include:
- innovation champions,
- service designers or process specialists,
- operational staff with direct user contact.

Basic training and shared skills in selected methods are essential to ensure consistency and quality across initiatives.

## Tools (non-exhaustive)
The objective is not to apply many methods, but to **select a small, shared and appropriate methodological base**.

Typical tools and frameworks include:
- Design thinking (lightweight, service-oriented)
- User journey mapping
- Problem framing and hypothesis formulation
- Continuous improvement methods (e.g. PDCA, Kaizen-inspired approaches)
- Simple service design tools adapted to the public sector

The level of methodological sophistication should match the targeted type of innovation.

## Key actions

### Incremental innovation (consolidate)
- Understand innovation as continuous, service-oriented improvement
- Use simple and proven methods
- Integrate existing user feedback (complaints, surveys, service feedback)
- Capitalise on existing processes, tools and skills

### Transformative innovation (reconfigure)
- Combine service-oriented and process-oriented methods
- Analyse end-to-end user journeys
- Identify major pain points for users and employees

### Disruptive innovation (explore)
- Use exploratory methods focused on future uses
- Work with hypotheses on needs and behaviours
- Accept uncertainty and progressive learning

## Common challenges / Watch out for
- Using overly complex methods without clear added value
- Lack of shared understanding of chosen methods
- Insufficient skills or training to apply methods correctly

## Practical example
A team maps a permit application journey using existing complaint data, identifying two quick wins that reduce processing time and user frustration.

## Next step
With clear and shared methods in place, the next step is to **integrate them into governance and daily operations**.
