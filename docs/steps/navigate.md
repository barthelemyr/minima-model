# Navigate — Choosing where to go

## Expected outcome
Select priority areas, define a clear strategic direction and reduce fragmentation, aligned with user needs, internal capacities and the intended creation of public value.

## Key actors
Decision-makers, coordinators and strategic leaders.

Depending on the context, this may include:
- senior management,
- policy owners,
- cross-departmental steering groups.

## Tools (non-exhaustive)
Navigation relies on **decision-support and prioritisation tools**.

Typical tools include:
- Strategic alignment matrices
- Problem or opportunity portfolios
- User-journey–based prioritisation
- Public value assessment frameworks
- Roadmaps or thematic focus areas

The goal is clarity, not exhaustive planning.

## Key actions

### Incremental innovation
**Setting direction**
- Prioritise concrete problems encountered by users
- Focus on visible and measurable improvements

**Reducing silos**
- Improve coordination within existing structures

### Transformative innovation
**Setting direction**
- Align innovation initiatives with strategic objectives
- Redefine priorities across services

**Reducing silos**
- Rethink value chains and user journeys
- Mobilise multiple units around shared goals

### Disruptive innovation
**Setting direction**
- Adopt a forward-looking, future-use-oriented approach
- Explore new roles for public administrations

**Reducing silos**
- Encourage cross-boundary collaboration
- Prioritise long-term vision over short-term optimisation

## Common challenges / Watch out for
- Too many priorities diluting impact
- Confusing strategic direction with operational planning
- Breaking silos without a shared objective
- Navigating without user input or assuming needs without validation

## Practical example
Leadership selects two priority user journeys for improvement, focusing innovation capacity where public value potential is highest.

## Next step
With a clear direction defined, the next step is to **iterate through testing, learning and controlled experimentation**.
