# Adapt — From adoption to culture

## Expected outcome
Anchor validated innovations sustainably in organisational practices, or consciously stop initiatives that do not create sufficient public value.

## Key actors
Leaders and employees committed to embedding innovation as a sustainable and responsible practice.

Depending on the context, this may include:
- senior leadership,
- HR and training units,
- communication teams.

## Tools (non-exhaustive)
Adaptation relies on **institutionalisation and change instruments**.

Typical tools include:
- Process documentation and standards
- Training and capability-building programmes
- Communication plans (internal and external)
- Policy, guideline or regulatory updates
- Structured “stop” or exit procedures

## Key actions

### Incremental innovation
- Standardise, document and disseminate
- Reinforce service quality and reliability

### Transformative innovation
- Adapt structures, roles and skills
- Integrate changes into strategy, governance and policies

### Disruptive innovation
- Decide on institutionalisation or termination
- Adapt regulatory and organisational frameworks where necessary

Communication is essential to explain decisions, share learning and maintain trust.
Stopping initiatives should be explicit, documented and respectful (“stop gracefully”).

## Common challenges / Watch out for
- Keeping unsuccessful initiatives alive by default
- Poor communication of decisions
- Treating adaptation as a one-time activity

## Practical example
An experiment is stopped, with lessons documented and shared internally to inform future initiatives.

## Next step
Adaptation closes one MINIMA cycle and prepares the organisation for **the next iteration**, with stronger capacity and clearer direction.
