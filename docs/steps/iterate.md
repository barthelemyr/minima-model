# Iterate — Test, adjust and prepare for scaling

## Expected outcome
Test solutions with real users, adjust based on concrete feedback, and decide on deployment while anticipating scalability and organisational impact.

## Key actors
Existing teams oriented towards experimentation.

Depending on the context, this may include:
- multidisciplinary project teams,
- service designers,
- users (citizens, businesses and partners) involved in testing.

## Tools (non-exhaustive)
Iteration relies on **experimentation and learning tools**.

Typical tools include:
- Prototypes (low- and medium-fidelity)
- Pilots and controlled trials
- User testing protocols
- Experiment canvases
- Feedback and learning loops

Clear distinctions must be made between:
- prototypes (learning tools),
- pilots (controlled real-world tests),
- experiments (exploration under uncertainty).

## Key actions

### Incremental innovation
- Lightweight and rapid prototyping
- Testing in real-life conditions
- Progressive deployment with quick adjustments

### Transformative innovation
- Structured pilots with defined scope
- User testing combined with change management
- Phased deployment anticipating scaling

### Disruptive innovation
- Time-limited experiments
- Testing uses and assumptions rather than final solutions
- Explicit decisions to continue, adapt or stop

## Common challenges / Watch out for
- Scaling too early without sufficient learning
- Confusing experimentation with unfinished deployment
- Missing clear decision points

## Practical example
A pilot service is tested with a limited user group, leading to three design changes before a decision on wider rollout.

## Next step
Once solutions have been tested and adjusted, the next step is to **measure their impact and learning**.
